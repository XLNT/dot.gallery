Hi,
thank you for ordering rotor.
I have very short instructions for you.
Please, read it.

RVRN
is feature that changes glyph's overlaping 
contours at 90 degrees to rectangle. 
It prevents the contour from pixel rounding 
differences when the contour is overlapped.

This feature is not wanted, 
when you want to apply stroke on the font.

turn it off f.e. in CSS with
font-feature-settings: "rvrn" 0;

If you don't know how to turn it off,
use rotor-Black-vf_no_rvrn.ttf

Please, contact me at jansindl3r@gmail.com,
if you need anything. 
I am very much willing to help

Happy experimenting,
Jan
